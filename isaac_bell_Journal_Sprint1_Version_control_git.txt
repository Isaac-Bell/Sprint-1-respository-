Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
        Git is a local programme for version control, while github is an online server where developers upload or 
        "push" different versions of files they might be working on individually or colabratively

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
        As described in one of the videos and maybe websites pushing a version from git to github is like a save point of that version,
         like taking a photo of board game. The photo has a time stamp on it and info of where everything is at that time. A version is
        like that and allows reference and the ability to restore that version if needed. 

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
        Abosolutely. 

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
        No, i went a bit far into commiting things to github as it was so fun and interseting...
