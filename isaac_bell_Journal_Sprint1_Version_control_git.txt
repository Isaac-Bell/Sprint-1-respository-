Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
        Git is a local programme for version control, while github is an online server where developers upload or 
        "push" different versions of files they might be working on individually or colabratively

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
        As described in one of the videos and maybe websites pushing a version from git to github is like a save point of that version,
         like taking a photo of board game. The photo has a time stamp on it and info of where everything is at that time. A version is
        like that and allows reference and the ability to restore that version if needed. 

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
        Abosolutely. 

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
        No, i went a bit far into commiting things to github as it was so fun and interseting...

What is a GitHub work flow?
        git hub work flow consists of working on branches wheter its the main branch or another branch, users can clone a version from Github, work on it locally by 
        making edits or new files, then staging and then finally pushing those files to GitHub, which then can be reviewed and pulled, or merged. 

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
        i felt quite engaged for most of it , apart from forgetting some of the commands from time to time was a bit frustrating. Sometimes when  i would feel a block i 
        get a drink of water and other times i would just ready slowly and keep going hoping i would pick it up as i went along 
Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
        Not really, it was quiete straight forward folloing along step by step so i don't know how i could have done it differently.
