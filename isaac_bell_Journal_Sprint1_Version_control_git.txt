Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
        Git is a local programme for version control, while github is an online server where developers upload or 
        "push" different versions of files they might be working on individually or colabratively

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
        As described in one of the videos and maybe websites pushing a version from git to github is like a save point of that version,
         like taking a photo of board game. The photo has a time stamp on it and info of where everything is at that time. A version is
        like that and allows reference and the ability to restore that version if needed. 

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
        Abosolutely. 

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
        No, i went a bit far into commiting things to github as it was so fun and interseting...

How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
        If the command line is like a catupult, staging would be loading the stone into the catupult and commiting would be firing it. The two stages are loading and firing, 
        like staging and commiting. In staging things are loaded to be ready to be commit. This could be muiltple files from jpg or html etc, and commiting is then like saving
        or taking a picture of only the loaded files.
